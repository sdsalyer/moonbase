# Telnet Negotiation Library

A Rust library for implementing Telnet protocol negotiation, designed with incremental development and extensibility in mind.

## Standards Compliance

This library implements the following RFCs:

- **RFC 854**: Telnet Protocol Specification (foundation)
- **RFC 1143**: The Q Method of Implementing TELNET Option Negotiation (state machine)
- More RFCs will be added incrementally as options are implemented

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: âœ… Minimal Structure
- [x] Basic crate structure and workspace integration
- [x] Module declarations and documentation framework
- [x] RFC reference system established

### Phase 2: âœ… Protocol Fundamentals  
- [x] Complete Telnet command set (IAC, WILL, WONT, DO, DONT, etc.)
- [x] Standard Telnet options (Echo, Terminal Type, NAWS, etc.)
- [x] MUD/MUSH protocol extensions (MCCP, MXP, GMCP, etc.)
- [x] Command/option serialization and deserialization
- [x] RFC compliance checking and categorization
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage and example demo

### Phase 3: âœ… Command Detection
- [x] IAC (Interpret As Command) sequence parsing with state machine
- [x] Byte stream separation (data vs commands)
- [x] Stateful parsing across multiple input chunks
- [x] Sub-negotiation sequence handling
- [x] Integration with Moonbase BBS for command logging
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage and demo example

### Phase 4: âœ… Option Negotiation State Machine  
- [x] RFC 1143 Q-method state machine implementation
- [x] WILL/WONT/DO/DONT handling with loop prevention
- [x] Automatic response generation
- [x] Queue system for rapid option changes
- [x] Option acceptance policy framework
- [x] Complete state tracking (NO/YES/WANTNO/WANTYES)
- [x] Integration with Moonbase BBS for live testing
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage and demo

### Phase 5: âœ… Stream Integration
- [x] TelnetStream wrapper around TcpStream
- [x] Integration with existing applications
- [x] Backward compatibility guarantees

### Phase 6: ðŸ”„ Specific Options
- [ ] Echo Option (RFC 857) - password input security
- [ ] Terminal Type (RFC 1091) - client identification  
- [ ] Window Size (RFC 1073) - responsive layouts

### Phase 7: ðŸ”„ Moonbase BBS Integration Enhancement
- [ ] Implement password masking using Echo option negotiation
- [ ] Auto-detect terminal capabilities for enhanced UX
- [ ] Auto terminal width detection and responsive layouts
- [ ] Auto ANSI support detection and adaptive rendering
- [ ] Auto color support detection and theme switching
- [ ] Configuration options for telnet feature auto-detection

### Phase 8: ðŸ”„ MUSH/MUD Extensions
- [ ] Sub-option negotiation framework
- [ ] MCCP (compression), MXP (markup), GMCP (JSON data)
- [ ] Extensible protocol plugin system

## MUSH/MUD Protocol Support

This library is specifically designed to support advanced MUD/MUSH protocols:

- **MCCP**: MUD Client Compression Protocol (data compression)
- **MXP**: MUD eXtension Protocol (HTML-like markup)
- **GMCP**: Generic MUD Communication Protocol (JSON out-of-band)
- **MSDP**: MUD Server Data Protocol (key-value data)
- **ATCP**: Achaea Telnet Client Protocol (game-specific)

## Usage

```rust
use telnet_negotiation::TelnetStream;
use std::net::TcpStream;
use std::io::Write;

// Phase 5: TelnetStream is now available!
let stream = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:2323")?;
let mut telnet_stream = TelnetStream::new(stream);

// Automatic negotiation happens transparently
telnet_stream.write(b"Hello, telnet world!")?;
```

## Current Status

**Phase 5 Complete**: TelnetStream integration implemented. All 35 tests passing.

### Available Features:
- Complete RFC 854 command set with byte conversion
- 40+ standard Telnet options plus MUD/MUSH extensions  
- Command categorization and RFC compliance checking
- Sequence serialization for protocol messages
- Stateful IAC sequence parsing from byte streams
- Data/command separation with partial sequence handling
- Sub-negotiation sequence support (IAC SB ... IAC SE)
- RFC 1143 compliant option negotiation state machine
- Loop-free WILL/WONT/DO/DONT handling
- Queue system for rapid option changes without loops
- Automatic response generation with proper state tracking
- Live integration with Moonbase BBS including response sending
- Option acceptance policy framework
- **NEW**: TelnetStream wrapper for transparent telnet protocol handling
- **NEW**: Drop-in replacement for TcpStream with Read/Write traits
- **NEW**: Automatic IAC byte escaping in outgoing data
- **NEW**: Clean data separation - telnet commands filtered from application data
- **NEW**: Background option negotiation without application intervention
- Comprehensive test coverage with demo examples

Ready to proceed to Phase 6: Specific Option Implementations.

## Phase 7 Preview: Enhanced BBS Experience

After implementing the core telnet options in Phase 6, Phase 7 will demonstrate their real-world value by enhancing the Moonbase BBS experience:

### Password Security (Echo Option - RFC 857)
- **Secure Login**: Password input will be properly masked using telnet echo negotiation
- **Industry Standard**: Follow proper telnet authentication patterns used by SSH, FTP, etc.

### Smart Terminal Detection  
- **Terminal Width**: Auto-detect client terminal width via NAWS (RFC 1073) for responsive menus
- **ANSI Support**: Auto-detect terminal capabilities via Terminal Type (RFC 1091)
- **Color Support**: Intelligent color theme selection based on terminal capabilities

### Configuration Enhancement
New `bbs.conf` options for auto-detection features:
```toml
[ui]
# Current static settings
box_style = "ascii"      # ascii, unicode, double
use_colors = false       # true, false
menu_width = 80          # fixed width

# New Phase 7 auto-detection settings  
terminal_width = "auto"  # auto, fixed number
ansi_support = "auto"    # auto, true, false
color_support = "auto"   # auto, true, false, adaptive
```

### User Experience Benefits
- **Responsive Design**: Menus automatically adapt to terminal width
- **Smart Themes**: Color themes activate only on capable terminals  
- **Security**: Proper password masking during login/registration
- **Compatibility**: Graceful fallback for legacy terminals

## Integration

This library is being developed alongside the Moonbase BBS project as a real-world use case and testing ground.
