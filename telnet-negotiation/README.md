# Telnet Negotiation Library

A Rust library for implementing Telnet protocol negotiation, designed with incremental development and extensibility in mind.

## Standards Compliance

This library implements the following RFCs:

- **RFC 854**: Telnet Protocol Specification (foundation)
- **RFC 1143**: The Q Method of Implementing TELNET Option Negotiation (state machine)
- More RFCs will be added incrementally as options are implemented

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: âœ… Minimal Structure
- [x] Basic crate structure and workspace integration
- [x] Module declarations and documentation framework
- [x] RFC reference system established

### Phase 2: âœ… Protocol Fundamentals  
- [x] Complete Telnet command set (IAC, WILL, WONT, DO, DONT, etc.)
- [x] Standard Telnet options (Echo, Terminal Type, NAWS, etc.)
- [x] MUD/MUSH protocol extensions (MCCP, MXP, GMCP, etc.)
- [x] Command/option serialization and deserialization
- [x] RFC compliance checking and categorization
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage and example demo

### Phase 3: âœ… Command Detection
- [x] IAC (Interpret As Command) sequence parsing with state machine
- [x] Byte stream separation (data vs commands)
- [x] Stateful parsing across multiple input chunks
- [x] Sub-negotiation sequence handling
- [x] Integration with Moonbase BBS for command logging
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage and demo example

### Phase 4: âœ… Option Negotiation State Machine  
- [x] RFC 1143 Q-method state machine implementation
- [x] WILL/WONT/DO/DONT handling with loop prevention
- [x] Automatic response generation
- [x] Queue system for rapid option changes
- [x] Option acceptance policy framework
- [x] Complete state tracking (NO/YES/WANTNO/WANTYES)
- [x] Integration with Moonbase BBS for live testing
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage and demo

### Phase 5: ðŸ”„ Stream Integration
- [ ] TelnetStream wrapper around TcpStream
- [ ] Integration with existing applications
- [ ] Backward compatibility guarantees

### Phase 6: ðŸ”„ Specific Options
- [ ] Echo Option (RFC 857) - password input security
- [ ] Terminal Type (RFC 1091) - client identification
- [ ] Window Size (RFC 1073) - responsive layouts

### Phase 7: ðŸ”„ MUSH/MUD Extensions
- [ ] Sub-option negotiation framework
- [ ] MCCP (compression), MXP (markup), GMCP (JSON data)
- [ ] Extensible protocol plugin system

## MUSH/MUD Protocol Support

This library is specifically designed to support advanced MUD/MUSH protocols:

- **MCCP**: MUD Client Compression Protocol (data compression)
- **MXP**: MUD eXtension Protocol (HTML-like markup)
- **GMCP**: Generic MUD Communication Protocol (JSON out-of-band)
- **MSDP**: MUD Server Data Protocol (key-value data)
- **ATCP**: Achaea Telnet Client Protocol (game-specific)

## Usage (Future)

```rust
use telnet_negotiation::TelnetStream;
use std::net::TcpStream;

// Phase 5: This API doesn't exist yet
let stream = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:2323")?;
let mut telnet_stream = TelnetStream::new(stream);

// Automatic negotiation happens transparently
telnet_stream.write(b"Hello, telnet world!")?;
```

## Current Status

**Phase 4 Complete**: RFC 1143 Q-method option negotiation implemented. All 32 tests passing.

### Available Features:
- Complete RFC 854 command set with byte conversion
- 40+ standard Telnet options plus MUD/MUSH extensions  
- Command categorization and RFC compliance checking
- Sequence serialization for protocol messages
- Stateful IAC sequence parsing from byte streams
- Data/command separation with partial sequence handling
- Sub-negotiation sequence support (IAC SB ... IAC SE)
- **NEW**: RFC 1143 compliant option negotiation state machine
- **NEW**: Loop-free WILL/WONT/DO/DONT handling
- **NEW**: Queue system for rapid option changes without loops
- **NEW**: Automatic response generation with proper state tracking
- **NEW**: Live integration with Moonbase BBS including response sending
- **NEW**: Option acceptance policy framework
- Comprehensive test coverage with demo examples

Ready to proceed to Phase 5: TelnetStream Integration.

## Integration

This library is being developed alongside the Moonbase BBS project as a real-world use case and testing ground.
